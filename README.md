Machine learning and pattern classification are fundamental blocks in the design of an intelligent
system. This course will introduce the fundamentals of machine learning and pattern classification
concepts, theories, and algorithms. Topics covered include: Bayesian decision theory, linear
discriminant functions, multilayer neural networks, classifier evaluation, and an introduction to
unsupervised clustering/grouping, self-organization and evolutionary computation
